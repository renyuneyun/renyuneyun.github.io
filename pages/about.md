# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br />
I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, [working on modelling data use policy using formal methods](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1623641/index.html).<br />
Arch Linux is my main distro. I do some FLOSS development in spare time (currently mainly on [Easer](/projects/)).<br />

Generally, I'm interested in everything that strengthens people's ability and cooperation, especially those enhancing people's understanding and control.<br />
I consider non-centralized services a good way of de-powering the capital for short-term profit while en-powering long-term productivity.<br />
For the same reason, I consider *free software* not only a terminology, but the ideology and methodology.

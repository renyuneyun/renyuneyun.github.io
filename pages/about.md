# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**.

I'm currently a Postdoc at the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford. I work for the [EWADA (Ethical Web And Data Architecture)](https://ewada.ox.ac.uk/) project, at the [Human-Centred Computing group](https://hcc.cs.ox.ac.uk/), with Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Sir Tim Berners-Lee. See [the Research page](/research/) for more details.

Generally, I'm interested in everything that strengthens people's ability and cooperation, especially those enhancing people's understanding and control, and those that are resilient. \
I consider non-centralized services a good way of de-powering the capital for short-term profit while en-powering long-term productivity. \
For the same reason, I consider *free software* not only a terminology, but the ideology and methodology.

Archlinux is my main distro. I do some FLOSS development in spare time (see [Coding](/coding/)).

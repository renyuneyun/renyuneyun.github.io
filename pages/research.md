# In [EWADA](https://ewada.ox.ac.uk/)

My current work mainly involves improving the privacy and empowering users of data use in decentralised data architectures like [SoLiD (Social Linked Data)](https://solidproject.org/). That mainly lies on the following topics:

1. How to securely and efficiently (collaboratively) use multiple users' data in a decentralised data architecture? [[ref]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16365)
2. How to empower users and give them more control and understanding of their data use? [[ref]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07587)
      1. What governance requirements the users and the applications would have?
      2. How to use a sensible data Terms of Use framework to lower the user's recognition overhead?
3. What challenges and opportunities do Large-Language Models or personal agents bring? [[ref]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10408)
4. How to properly facilitate users to use the the technologies we provided?

As a result, technologies include Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), formal modelling and reasoning, and semantic technologies.


Some topics also bridge back with my PhD work on modelling and reasoning of data-use policies in decentralised contexts.

# PhD work

My PhD work mainly focused on formally modelling and compliance reasoning of data-use policies (or data Terms of Use, as we call it now) in decentralised collaboration contexts (e.g. interdisciplinary research / collaboration like e-Science). That involves the following questions: 

1. How to formally model data-use policies taking the properties of decentralised contexts into account?
2. How to deal with the Multi-Input-Multi-Output nature of the workflows in such data-processing contexts?
3. How to derive the data-use policies for the output data?
4. How to check compliance of such policies?

See [my previous research homepage](https://renyuneyun.github.io/portfolio-phd) for more details if interested.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, working with Prof. Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Prof. Sir Tim Berners-Lee (at the [EWADA Project](https://ewada.ox.ac.uk/)), on user-centered data usage control and user-centered AI, on decentralized Web or alike contexts, especially [SoLiD (Social Linked Data)](https://solidproject.org/).  \
Prior to this, I obtained PhD degree from the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. Malcolm Atkinson, Dr. Petros Papapanagiotou and Prof. Jacques Fleuriot, working on data-governance rules of eSceience contexts.

In general, my research surrounds data governance, data usage control and data protection mechanisms, especially in decentralized / multi-stakeholder contexts. It mainly concerns the technical mechanism design, but also considers user perspectives and expectations. (Neural-)Symbolic AI / Logic and Privacy-Enhancing Technology are the main elements for the technical parts. Data and user (empowerment) are the main factors. They can be organized into the following topics:

1. Data Terms of Use (DToU): How to empower users and give them more control and understanding of their data use? [[ref]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07587)
      - Regulatory / Compliance: what is the *status quo*, and (how) can we improve that?
2. Data privacy: How to securely and efficiently use multiple users' data (collaboratively) in a decentralised data architecture? [[ref]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16365)
3. GenAI: What challenges and opportunities do Large-Language Models (LLMs) or personal agents bring (to facilitate people)? [[ref]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10408)
      - See also [Tim Berners-Lee's design notes](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PrivateData.html) on this topic
4. User perception: how do users perceive the issues of data and how can we facilitate them?


## Link to PhD work

The DToU topic also bridge back with my PhD work on modelling and reasoning of data-use policies, in interdisciplinary research / collaboration contexts (e.g. e-Science), with the following questions:

1. How to formally model data-use policies taking the properties of decentralised contexts into account?
2. How to deal with the Multi-Input-Multi-Output nature of the workflows in such data-processing contexts?
3. How to derive the data-use policies for the output data?
4. How to check compliance of such policies?

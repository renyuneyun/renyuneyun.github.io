I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [HCC group](https://hcc.cs.ox.ac.uk/), Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, working with Prof. Sir Nigel Shadbolt and Prof. Sir Tim Berners-Lee (at the [EWADA project](https://ewada.ox.ac.uk/)), on user-centered data usage control and user-centered AI, on decentralized Web or alike contexts, especially [SoLiD (Social Linked Data)](https://solidproject.org/).  
Prior to this, I obtained PhD degree from [AIAI](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/aiai), School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh, supervised by Prof. Malcolm Atkinson, Dr. Petros Papapanagiotou and Prof. Jacques Fleuriot.

In general, my research surrounds data governance, data usage control and data privacy, especially in decentralized / multi-stakeholder contexts. It mainly concerns the technical mechanism design, but also considers user perspectives and expectations.  
(Neural-)Symbolic AI, Knowledge Graph and Privacy-Enhancing Technology are the main topics for the technical parts. Data, accountability and user (empowerment) are the main factors.  
More specifically, the following themes are covered:

1. Data Terms of Use (DToU): How do we make data usage more accountable and controllable (and easy), for all stakeholders, especially regular people? [[ref]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07587)
      - Regulatory / Compliance: what is the *status quo*, and (how) can we improve that?
2. Data privacy: How to securely and efficiently use multiple users' data (collaboratively) in a decentralised data architecture? [[ref]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16365)
3. GenAI: What challenges and opportunities do Large-Language Models (LLMs) or personal agents bring (to facilitate people)? [[ref]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10408)
      - See also [Tim Berners-Lee's design notes](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/PrivateData.html) on this topic
4. User perception: how do users perceive (the issues of) data and how can we facilitate them?

###### Linking back to PhD work

The DToU topic bridges back with my PhD work on modelling and reasoning of data-use policies, in research / collaboration contexts (e.g. e-Science, scientific workflows), with MIMO workflows. See [my previous research homepage](https://renyuneyun.github.io/portfolio-phd) for more details if interested.

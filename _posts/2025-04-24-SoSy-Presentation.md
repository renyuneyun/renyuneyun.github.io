I gave a talk at the [Information Retrieval in Decentralized and Federated Systems session](https://espressoproject.org/information-retrieval-in-decentralized-and-or-federated-systems/) (hosted by the [ESPRESSO team](https://espressoproject.org/about/)) at Solid Symposium 2025, showing some uncommon, emerging, useful techniques for privacy-preserving information retrieval in decentralized contexts.

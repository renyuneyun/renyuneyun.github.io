---

I am co-organising the [3rd Privacy Session](https://besteves4.github.io/sosy2025-privacy/) at [Solid Symposium 2025](https://www.sosy2025.eu/) (Leiden University, 24th - 25th April), with Dr. Beatriz Esteves (Ghent University) and Dr. Chang Sun (Maastricht University).

This session is dedicated to data governance, privacy and control, especially for personal data, in [Solid](https://solidproject.org/)-like decentralised contexts. If you have anything to say or argue, please consider submitting a short paper or extended abstract!
